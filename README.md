# Javascript Quiz

## Description

A brief quiz was made to test the user's knowledge of JavaScript. The user will be able to do the quiz and get a score based on their performance, 10 points will be taken off the score for every wrong answer. The final score can be saved so the user is able to compare his JavaScript knowledge with his peers.
Building this quiz allowed me to get confortable reading other people's code as i did need to research and find out how people approached building a similar project. It also allowed me to get familiarized with JavaScript concepts that I have not learned yet, like operational chaining and the coalecent operator. It forced me to be organized and review my code so I can ensure it follows the correct path when functions need to call other functions. It was a challenging project but it did pay off.
